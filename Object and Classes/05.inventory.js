/*
Create a function, which creates a register for heroes, with their names, level, and items (if they have such).
The input comes as an array of strings. Each element holds data for a hero, in the following format:
"{heroName} / {heroLevel} / {item1}, {item2}, {item3}..."

You must store the data about every hero. The name is a string, a level is a number and the items are all strings.

The output is all of the data for all the heroes youâ€™ve stored sorted ascending by level. The data must be in the following format for each hero:
Hero: {heroName}
level => {heroLevel}
Items => {item1}, {item2}, {item3}

Note: If there are two heroes with the same name, they should be treated as different individuals and the name should be printed twice.
