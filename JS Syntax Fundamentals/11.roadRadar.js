/*Write a function that determines whether a driver is within the speed limit. You will receive the speed and the area. Each area has a different limit:

路 On the motorway, the limit is 130 km/h

路 On the interstate, the limit is 90 km/h

路 In the city, the limit is 50 km/h

路 Within a residential area, the limit is 20 km/h

If the driver is within the limits, there should be a printed speed and the speed limit.

`Driving {speed} km/h in a {speed limit} zone`

If the driver is over the limit, however, your function should print the severity of the infraction and the difference in speeds.

`The speed is {difference} km/h faster than the allowed speed of {speed limit} - {status}`

For speeding up to 20 km/h over the limit, the status should be speeding.

For speeding up to 40 km/h over the limit, the status should be excessive speeding.

For anything else, status should be reckless driving.

The input comes as 2 string parameters. The first element is the current speed (number), the second element is the area.

The output should be printed on the console.*/
